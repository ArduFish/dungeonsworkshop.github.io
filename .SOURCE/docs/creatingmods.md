**This Page is still a work-in-progress.**

To get started on creating mods for **Minecraft Dungeons**, you first need to unpack the game files to be able to edit them.
To do that, you need the following:
**[QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.zip)**,
**[The Dungeons script for QuickBMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iRnav4y9PyvTvGWmUqHZcaRGrGSAVDh5/view?usp=sharing)**,
**The game, Launcher or Windows Store version (After following [Installing Mods](https://docs.dungeonsworkshop.net/gettingstarted/))**

1. Extract **QuickBMS** into a folder.
2. Put the Dungeons script into the same folder as **QuickBMS**.
3. Start **QuickBMS**. It will prompt you to select a .bms file, choose the Dungeons.bms file in the same folder.
4. In the next window, navigate to your **Minecraft Dungeons** installation directory.

  !!! Note
  (For Windows Store, the folder you chose when installing)
  
5. Navigate into the Dungeons/Content/Paks folder, and select all **pakchunkX-WindowsNoEditor.pak** files. 
6. In the next window, select the **output** folder where the extracted game assets should be saved.
7. The script will now unpack the .pak files. When it is done, press **Enter** to exit.

  !!! Note
  You can also repeat this process for all mod .pak files, to see what the mod contains or what it's made of.
