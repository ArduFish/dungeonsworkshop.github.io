	<h3>**Extracting Game Assets**</h3>

To get started on creating mods for **Minecraft Dungeons**, you first need to unpack the game files to be able to edit them.
To do that, you need the following:  

!!! Note "Prerequisites"
		**[QuickBMS](https://aluigi.altervista.org/papers/quickbms.zip)**,  
		**[The Dungeons script for QuickBMS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iRnav4y9PyvTvGWmUqHZcaRGrGSAVDh5/view?usp=sharing)**,  
		**The game, launcher or Windows Store version (After following "[Installing Mods](https://docs.dungeonsworkshop.net/gettingstarted/)")**  

1. Extract **QuickBMS** into a folder.  
2. Put the Dungeons script into the same folder as **QuickBMS**.  
3. Start **QuickBMS**. It will prompt you to select a .bms file, choose the Dungeons.bms file in the same folder.  
4. In the next window, navigate to your **Minecraft Dungeons** installation directory.  

	!!! Note
		(For Windows Store, you need the folder you chose when you were following **"[Installing Mods](https://docs.dungeonsworkshop.net/gettingstarted/)"**)
  
5. Navigate into the Dungeons/Content/Paks folder, and select all **pakchunkX-WindowsNoEditor.pak** files. 
6. In the next window, select the **output** folder where the extracted game assets should be saved.
7. The script will now unpack the .pak files. When it is done, press **Enter** to exit.

  !!!  Note 
  You can also repeat this process for all mod .pak files, to see what the mod contains or what it's made of.
  !!! Note 
			(If the Launcher displays "Repair", just click on that button to start the update.)
